      Provides shortcuts to reorder Java class members inside a file, similar to Move Line Up (ALT+UP) and Move Line Down (ALT+DOWN)
but on a higher level.

For example, you can swap the method the cursor is currently
in with the method above it. This is a lot faster than first
selecting the whole method and than moving it up line by line
until it is above the other one.

Works inside all Java types and with all members (fields, methods,
nested classes/interfaces, etc.).

Shortcuts on Windows &amp; Linux:
CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+UP
CTRL+SHIFT+ALT+DOWN

Shortcuts on OS X:
CMD+SHIFT+OPTION+UP
CMD+SHIFT+OPTION+DOWN
